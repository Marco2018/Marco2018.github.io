Graph非常常见

1. social networks
2. proteins
3. chemical compounds
4. program file graph



How to analysis graph

Node-level representaion learning:
shallow structure: Deepwalk LIne

Deep: SDNE GCN Graphsage

Graph-level:

GCN Graphsage GIN



Consider graph-level similarity search

graph query in graph database -> descending similarity graph

Two types of graph-level opeartors:

Graph similarity opeartor
$$
G×G  -> R
$$
Graph embedding 
$$
G->R^d
$$
deeplearning + embedding更快



Graph Edit Distance:(np HARD)



feature engineering: graphlets
